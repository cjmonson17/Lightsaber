# Lightsaber
Machining Final Project: Lightsaber

The lightsaber was designed based on the lightsaber from George Lucas's Star Wars movies and TV Shows. The lightsaber hilt is 13" in length and 1.5" in diameter. Along with the hilt is a 3' acrylic tube that represents the "blade." The lightsaber consists of 7 parts that are attached via threading of different diameters. The lightsaber has an additional piece that allows the blade to be removed from its hilt. Inside the main body are two set screws that allow a crystal (representing the Kyber crystal from the Star Wars mythos) to be placed within the hilt.
