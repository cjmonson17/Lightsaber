# Lightsaber
Machining Final Project: Lightsaber

The lightsaber was designed based on the lightsaber from George Lucas's Star Wars movies and TV Shows. The lightsaber hilt is 13" in length and 1.5" in diameter. Along with the hilt is a 3' acrylic tube that represents the "blade." The lightsaber consists of 7 parts that are attached via threading of different diameters. The lightsaber has an additional piece that allows the blade to be removed from its hilt. Inside the main body are two set screws that allow a crystal (representing the Kyber crystal from the Star Wars mythos) to be placed within the hilt.

Each piece can screw together. The threads were made using a lathe and taps and dyes

Kyber Crystals: In the Star Wars lore, the crystals power the blade. Each color has different attributes

This is where the crystal would be housed. The crystal is held in place by two set screws on the top and bottom

Here are some of the initial designs. The lightsaber was designed with the intention of being able to be deconstructed and put back together. The dimensions were loosely based on Star Wars canon dimensions for a large, single blade lightsaber.
